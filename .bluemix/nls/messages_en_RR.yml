template.name: "Develop and Deploy application to Kubernetes or OpenShift using deployment strategies~otc-ui3881"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop an application and deploy to a single IBM Kubernetes Service / RedHat openshift cluster or to multiple clusters using IBM Satellite.  The template provides you with choices of advanced deployment strategies like Rolling, Blue/Green or Canary to cater to your needs. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, but you can also bring your own app and link to it instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with [Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/va?topic=va-va_index), [Code Risk Analyzer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd-configure-cra-repos), source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\n You can manage your IBM Cloud Container clusters using the [console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes)~otc-ui3882"
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new docker image build, which will be scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed to the Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes) for this toolchain.~otc-ui3883"
deploy.longDescription: "Enter a name for the app that you want to deploy. Create a new IBM Cloud API Key or use an existing IBM Cloud API Key to retrieve your IBM Container Registry configuration to store the built application docker image and IBM Kubernetes Cluster configuration to deploy the built images.\n\n**Note**: If the cluster namespace doesn't exist, it is automatically created and configured for you.~otc-ui3884"
