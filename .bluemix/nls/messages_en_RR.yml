template.name: "Develop and Deploy application to Kubernetes using deployment strategies~otc-ui2037"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop an application and deploy to a kubernetes cluster managed by the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.  The template provides you with choices of advanced deployment strategies like Rolling, Blue/Green or Canary to cater to your needs. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, but you can also bring your own app and link to it instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with [Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/va?topic=va-va_index), [Code Risk Analyzer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd-configure-cra-repos), source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\n You can manage your IBM Cloud Container clusters using the [console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://github.com/open-toolchain/sdk/wiki/Develop-and-deploy-an-application-on-Kubernetes-using-deployment-strategies)~otc-ui2038"
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new docker image build, which will be scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed to the Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://github.com/open-toolchain/sdk/wiki/Develop-and-deploy-an-application-on-Kubernetes-using-deployment-strategies) for this toolchain.~otc-ui2039"
deploy.longDescription: "Enter a name for the app that you want to deploy. Create a new IBM Cloud API Key or use an existing IBM Cloud API Key to retrieve your IBM Container Registry configuration to store the built application docker image and IBM Kubernetes Cluster configuration to deploy the built images.\n\n**Note**: If the cluster namespace doesn't exist, it is automatically created and configured for you.~otc-ui2040"
deploy.appDescription: "Enter a name for the app that you want to deploy.~otc-ui2041"
deploy.blueGreen.longDescription: "**Blue-Green Strategy** leverage two permanent production environments (blue and green) with only one receiving traffic at any time. Deploy the new release to the idle environment, then switch all traffic to it with no downtime. For rapid rollback, simply switch all traffic back to the other environment that remained unchanged.\n\nEnter a name for the app that you want to deploy. Create a new IBM Cloud API Key or use an existing IBM Cloud API Key to retrieve your IBM Container Registry configuration to store the built application docker image and IBM Kubernetes Cluster configuration to deploy the built images.~otc-ui2042"
deploy.rolling.longDescription: "**Rolling Strategy** deploys a new release with no downtime by incrementally updating all its instances in a rapid manner. Rollback requires redeploying the previous release, which may not be immediate.\n\nEnter a name for the app that you want to deploy. Create a new IBM Cloud API Key or use an existing IBM Cloud API Key to retrieve your IBM Container Registry configuration to store the built application docker image and IBM Kubernetes Cluster configuration to deploy the built images.~otc-ui2043"
deploy.canary.longDescription: "**Canary Strategy** deploys a new release in parallel with the original production environment, with no downtime, then incrementally route more traffic to it until it replaces the original one which can be torn down. For rapid rollback during progressive rollout, all traffic can be routed back to the original production environment.\n\nEnter a name for the app that you want to deploy.
