template.name: "Develop and Deploy application to Kubernetes or OpenShift using deployment strategies~otc-ui4265"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop an application and deploy to a single IBM Kubernetes Service / RedHat openshift cluster or to multiple clusters using IBM Satellite.  The template provides you with choices of advanced deployment strategies like Rolling, Blue/Green or Canary to cater to your needs. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, but you can also bring your own app and link to it instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with [Vulnerability Advisor](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/va?topic=va-va_index), [Code Risk Analyzer](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd-configure-cra-repos), source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\n You can manage your IBM Cloud Container clusters using the [console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/clusters).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes)~otc-ui4266"
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new docker image build, which will be scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed to the Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-tutorial-cd-kubernetes) for this toolchain.~otc-ui4267"
deploy.longDescription: "Enter a name for the app that you want to deploy.
